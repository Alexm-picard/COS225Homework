The four principles of oop are Encapsulation, 
Polymorphism, Abstraction, and Inheratance.
Encapsulation involes the use of private and protected key words to keep the defined variables from being directly changed and can only be changed from helper function defined later on in the same class.
Polymorphism is known as overloading since you can make many functions with the same name with different number of arguments.
Abstraction involves hiding all irrelevant data that isn't needed to improve the code run speed, while also reducing the complexity of the code.
Inheratance is making a new class that will take the structure of the class that it is inheriting from a parent class with the added functions from the child class
